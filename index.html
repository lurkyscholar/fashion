I'm not always very good at dressing myself, and I don't have any particular urge to dress other people, but I've always been interested in fashion. 
  As a kid, I obsessed over the nuances and rules and codes of it all. I watched Project Runway and What Not to Wear. 
  I played dress up games online and coveted all the fashion design crafts in the toy store. 
  I made clothes for all my stuffed animals and I knew that the secrets to what I needed to know were to be found in Teen Vogue magazine. 
  I learned to sew and knit and embroider and I always imagined myself making dresses and skirts and shirts and co-ord ensembles. 
<p>
The part I had a hard time articulating though was that I didn't want to wear these things. 
  I didn't want anyone to wear anything I made (except for my Webkinz.)
  I liked the aart of design, the craft of pattern-making, fashion as a process. 
  I understood that I was a boy and I wanted to wear boy clothes (whatever that means). I always had. 
  I didn't <i>play</i> with dolls, I just wanted to dress them, carefully, for wherever they were going. 
  I did not communicate this to anyone, and I did not know what to do. I dressed myself poorly, I broke every rule I read, I mismatched and mixed prints, I grew up, I bought 'girl clothes' from Target and the mall, I cried in dressing rooms, I did not want to be seen. 
  I looked at Teen Vogue in shame until I didn't like to look at it anymore. 
<p>
 At some point in high school I became interested in fashion again. That is to say, I didn't feel so embarassed to read magazines anymore, and I found new ones I liked, and I watched my favorite runway shows on youtube, and I found places I liked to shop without crying.
  I could be the doll when it suited me, and no one would notice if I wanted to wear boy clothes too. 
  
 <p>
At another point in high school, my personal instagram account "blew up." I could see people seeing me, pointing me out to their friends, whispering about my clothes, my hair. 
I posed for pictures. I was recognized by the 'fashionable' students in my grade. I was quietly, awkwardly "influencing." This was not important, nor was it my intention, and I fought to stop it from going to my head (it did a little bit.)

 
<p>
 The year I graduated high school, I obsessively bought and hoarded vintage sewing patterns and interesting fabrics, patterning books and vintage fashion magazines.
  I watched the entirety of the Ultimate Fashion History series on youtube. 
  I read books and watched documentaries about fashion history and what it had to do with culture and celebrity.
  I was fascinated by the grotesquely superficial--especially the 2000s and what I would come to refer to as "aesthetics of objectification."
  I was prepared to be a student of fashion, but I was not prepared for the idea of what it would mean to go to fashion school. 
<p>
 By 2018, I had failed at being a person, lost everything, and left my life behind. Though I brought my hoarded sewing patterns and magazines and interesting fabrics with me to my dad's house in Ohio, I left my fashion aspirations somewhere in my old bedroom. 
 Eventually, I enrolled in an online class called Fashion Business Essentials, sponsored and heavily marketed by Parson and Teen Vogue. 
 I didn't finish the course, and I didn't tell my dad that I never got the certificate. 
  
 <p> Now that I'm better, that is, I feel better, I'm allowed to wear things I like again (as long as I don't think about it too hard.) For a while, I wasn't able to. 
   Nothing pleases and disturbs me so much as this thing called "fashion."
